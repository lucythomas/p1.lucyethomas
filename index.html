      <h3>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h3>
        <p>I recently started working at Harvard University's Wyss Institute as a Digital Content Coordinator. I update and provide support for the Institute website and other digital media and deploy HTML emails. My academic background is in Art History and Religious studies, and over the past few years I have been learning front-end web development both on my own and at the Harvard Extension School.</p>
      <h3>Why are you taking this course?</h3>
        <p>I want to deepen my abilities and learn about server-side web development, which is something that until now I have had little experience with.</p>
      <h3>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h3>
        <p>I have taken two previous courses at Harvard Extension School: Understanding and Developing Interactive Media, and Introduction to Programming with Javascript. I have also taken online tutorials in html and css, and in my current position I use html on a daily basis to update webpages and create html emails.</p>
      <h3>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h3>
        <p>I use a Mac.</p>
      <h3>Anything else we should know?</h3>
        <p>I am excited to take this course!</p>
